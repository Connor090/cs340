When writing programs, I try to keep them maintainable, readable, and adaptable by using clear variable names, adding comments, and organizing code into separate modules. In Project One, I built a CRUD Python module that I later used in Project Two to connect the database to the dashboard widgets. This was helpful because it made the code easier to understand and reuse. I could also use the CRUD module in future projects that need database connections, like a web app or other software tools.

As a software engineering student, I usually approach problems by breaking them down into smaller steps and solving one part at a time. For the Grazioso Salvare project, I started by looking at the requirements and figuring out how the database and dashboard should work together. This project felt different from earlier assignments because it was more focused on meeting a clientâ€™s needs, not just writing code for practice. In the future, I would use strategies like planning out requirements carefully, keeping code modular, and testing as I go to make sure the final product works the way it should.

Software engineers create tools and solutions that help people and companies do their work better. In a project like this, the dashboard could help Grazioso Salvare keep track of important data and make faster decisions about deploying rescue dogs. Projects like this show how software can make real tasks easier, save time, and help organizations reach their goals.
